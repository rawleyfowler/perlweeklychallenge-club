### Implementation

# Looping over three indices and comparing number pairs would be
# straightforward.  Following a somewhat funnier approach.
#
# Considering transitions from one element of the list L to another
# according to some constraints defined by a matrix A.  The transition
# from element at index i to the element at index j is allowed, if the
# matrix element a(i,j) is nonzero.  Given there is a second transition
# from an element at index j to an element at index k defined by a
# matrix B in the same manner, then a transition from index i to index k
# via any index j is defined by the matrix product B A.  Similarly a
# third transition from index k to index l defined by C defines a
# transition from i to l as described by C B A.  Here in our task the
# transition from l to k shall return back to the starting index i.
# Thus all possible starting indices can be found from the nonzero
# elements of the diagonal in the matrix product C B A.
#
# The possible back transitions from one index to its predecessor is
# given by the transpose of the forward transition matrix.
#
# The three (forward) transitions are:
# 1) i -> j is allowed if i < j and L(i) < L(j)
# 2) j -> k is allowed if j < k and L(j) > L(k)
# 3) k -> l is allowed if k > l and L(k) > L(l)
#
# The index order can be specified by an (upper or lower) triangular
# matrix of zeroes and ones and the element order by the matrix of
# pairwise comparisons of all list elements with either 1 or -1 replaced
# by zero.  The logical AND between index and element relations can be
# achieved with an element-wise multiplication of the triangular and the
# clipped comparison matrix.
#
# Steps to solve the task:
# - Construct the matrix containing the comparison results between all
#   number pairs.
# - Construct a lower triangle matrix having the same dimensions.
# - Construct three transition matrices from the first element to the
#   second, from the second to the third and from the third back to the
#   first as described above.
#
# At this stage we are able to construct solutions instead of only
# searching for them and thus we'll not restrict the task to find the
# first 132-triple:
#
# Looping over all possible first indices as given by the nonzero
# elements of the diagonal of the three transition matrices' product.
#
# The second indices for a given first index must be successors of the
# first index as well as pre-predecessors thereof.
#
# Finally, the third indices for a given first and second index must be
# successors of the second index and predecessors of the first.
